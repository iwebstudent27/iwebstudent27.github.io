                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">June 28, 2019</div>
                <p>This week we learned about design patterns like image galleries, breadcrumb navs, modals, and
                    slideshows, etc. We also coded a custom image gallery of UI designs created in XD.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">July 5, 2019</div>
                <p>This week I used Adobe XD to create a working prototype of my website. the working prtotype enabled
                    me to click buttons. On the prototype you are able to test out new ideas and concepts. I also
                    learned different web
                    design terms like IA, UX, and UI. By the end of the week, we started planning for our final project.

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">June 28, 2019</div>
                <p>This week we started using photoshop to edit photos to our raster pictures. I also used photoshop to
                    clean up a photo of a sketch of the words Summer 2019 that I drew on the white board at school. I
                    then used Adobe XD to create a copy of my live webstie. This copy makes it easier for me to test out
                    new color schemes and pictures. Adobe XD enables me to be more creative. A link to my XD copy is in
                    my About page.</p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">June 21, 2019</div>
                <p>On Monday, we delted all the fake CSS and added in the important HTML. This HTML contained the
                    header, navigation,footer, and hero. I then created two sub-pages titled the About and Blog pages.
                    The About page contains all the resources that I had used so far. The Blog page were notes from the
                    past week.</p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">June 14, 2019</div>
                <p>We worked on getting our website live by creating a repo and copying it down from github. I then used
                    Termianl to clone the repo to my desktop. After that, I used VS Code to edit my readme file to
                    create my live website.</p>
